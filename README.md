# Anubhav-s_Resume
My personal/portfolio website build on Flutter Web and hosted on Firebase.

Flutter is a framework developed by Google which enables you to have a single code-base for Android, IoS, and Web.

This website is a SPA build on Flutter Web. It is responsive and ready for the mobile view as well. Flutter Web as of 30th June 2020 is not production-ready, so there might be certain issues with its performance.

Since this is an opensource project, you are free to use this template.

Please make sure you have installed Flutter Web using suitable commands if you want to clone & run this project & make some changes to it.

The changes can be made at the main. dart file present in the lib folder. This is the file where all the code has been written. 

If you find some issues, please create a pull request.

The original website can be accessed from here: https://anubhavsanyal-72f65.web.app
